# Verify that when a voter is demoted in a joint config, it will show up in
# learners_next until the joint config is left, and only then will the progress
# turn into that of a learner, without resetting the progress. Note that this
# last fact is verified by `next`, which can tell us which "round" the progress
# was originally created in.
